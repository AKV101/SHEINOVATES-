Team Name: Football Dummies


Our project lays out the fundamentals for a fantasy football game. We borrowed NFL Statistical Data from another repository (credit: MarcLinderGit). It contains player and team statistics of every week in the NFL season for the past 40 years. Our goal was to extract player stats from 2023, calculate points for each player based on our own logic, and display each player's points on a website. Users can access players' points to decide which player they want on their team.

The ultimate goal is to replicate a fantasy football game.
